1) 2 : {0,1}
2) 10 : {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9}
3) 2^7 = 128
4) m^n : size of bit to the power # of bits. How many values can 2 10bits hold? 10^2 = 100 :))
5) 1MB = 1 000 000 bytes, so 1,000,000 addresses ORRRR 1MB =  1,048,576 bytes and 1,048,576 addresses
6) same values above, but multiply by 8, so either 8,000,000 or  8,388,608 addresses
7) 1MB * 8B = 8MB
8) 8MB * 8B = 64MB


P2 2^20 / 2^10 = 2^10, = 1MB
